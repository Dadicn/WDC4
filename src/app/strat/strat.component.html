    Each of the strategies has its strengths and weaknesses, which I’ll discuss

    <h1>Remove</h1>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="how-to">
  <h1>
    The most obvious way to simplify is... <br />
    to remove what’s unnecessary
  </h1>
  <p>
    Conventional wisdom says that more features mean more capability which, in
    turn, means a more useful product. But these examples <br />
    choose depth of capability rather than breadth. They’re useful because they
    do a few things far better than their rivals. <br />

    <br />Conventional wisdom also says that products with more features will
    beat products with fewer. But all of these examples have <br />
    competed against more fully featured rivals and won.<br />

    <br />Removing clutter allowed designers to focus on solving a few important
    problems really well. It also allowed users to focus on meeting<br />
    their goals without distraction.<br />
  </p>
  <h1>How to remove?</h1>
  <p>
    Focus on what’s core<br />
    - Removing clutter helps users focus on what’s important<br />

    <br />Kill lame features<br />
    -We tenk to keep things, even when we know they’re broken<br />

    <br />Prioritizing features<br />
    - Prioritize feature that satisfy mainstreams’ needs with minimal effort

    <h1>Organize</h1>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="how-to">
  <h1>Organizing is a great strategy for simplifying.</h1>
  <p>
    There are plenty of options open to you in organizing an interface— size,
    color, position, shape, hierarchy. But those choices need to be <br />
    employed with restraint.<br />

    <br />If you want to organize for simplicity, it’s important to emphasize
    just one or two important things. Simple organization doesn’t draw<br />
    attention to itself, it lets users focus on what they’re doing.<br />
  </p>
  <h1>How to organize?</h1>
  <p>
    Chunking <br />
    - Chunking is used throughout user interface design. The classic advice here
    is to break items down into groups of “seven <br />
    plus or minus two.”<br />

    <br />Hard edges<br />
    -When you need to organize a group of items that are equivalent (like books
    in an online store), choose clear categories with labels<br />
    that make sense to your audience.<br />
    Grids<br />
    -It’s remarkable how far a tidy layout can go in making a design feel
    simple. The form on the opposite page (top) is an interface for searching
    for<br />
    train tickets that my company designed. It worked fine in user testing, but
    people hesitated over it. We revisited the<br />
    layout and decided we could simplify it.

    <h1>Hide</h1>

<div class="how-to">
  <h1>Make sure your users will encounter a clue on their journey</h1>
  <p>
    There are plenty of options open to you in organizing an interface— size,
    color, position, shape, hierarchy. But those choices need to be <br />
    employed with restraint.<br />

    <br />

    or two important things. Simple organization doesn’t draw<br />
    attention to itself, it lets users focus on what they’re doing.<br />
  </p>

  <h1>How to hide?</h1>

  <p>
    Hide one-time settings and options.<br />

    <br />Hide precision controls, but let expert users choose to keep them
    revealed.<br />

    <br />Don’t force or expect mainstreamers to customize, but offer this
    option for experts.<br />

    <br />Hide elegantly; that is, hide completely and reveal just in time.
  </p>

<div class="rohd">
  <div class="rohd-title">
    <h1>Displace</h1>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="how-to">
  <h1>The fourth strategy is to cheat?!</h1>
  <p>
    Designers who take this approach strip the site down to a few basic
    actions.<br />

    <br />
    Also, though you’ve simplified the site, you still have the problem of
    designing a simple on-screen menu system (using the strategies<br />
    of remove, organize, and hide).<br />

    <br />But if you understand the trade-offs, displacing the right roles to
    the right devices works well. One of the secrets of creating simple<br />
    experiences is putting the right functionality on the right platform or part
    of the system.<br />
  </p>

  <h1>How to displace?</h1>

  <p>
    You can reduce complexity in software by designing features that can be used
    for several purposes. The task of choosing how to use <br />
    them is displaced to users.<br />

    <br />The ultimate in simple interfaces are ones that make sense to experts
    and mainstreamers alike.<br />

    <br />You need a sense of certainty to be able to displace tasks
    effectively.<br />

    <br />If you’re going to displace tasks to be the responsibility of the
    user, you have to trust that the user will take on those tasks.
